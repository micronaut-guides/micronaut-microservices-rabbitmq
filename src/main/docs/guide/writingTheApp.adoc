Lets describe the microservices you are going to build through the tutorial.

* `books` - It returns a list of books. It uses a domain consisting of a book name and isbn. It also publish a message in
RabbitMQ every time a book is accessed.

* `analytics` - It connects to RabbitMQ to update the analytics for every book (a counter). It also exposes an endpoint
to get the analytics.
