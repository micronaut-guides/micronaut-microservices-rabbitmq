The fastest way to start using https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/[RabbitMQ is via Docker]:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -it \
        --network=host \ # <1>
        rabbitmq:3.7.11-management
----
<1> Instead of manually expose all the necessary ports we just use the same network as the host

Alternatively you can https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html[install and run a local RabbitMQ instance].
